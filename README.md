# Weather Dashboard

Without any starter file we were tasked with making a weather dashboard that would display the current weather and next 5 days forecast weather for any given city. We were to use the openweathermap API to get the weather data.

## Pseudo Code

The following is my thought process for what I needed to happen.
1. When the page loads, it just shows a search bar and asks for a city.
2. When the user enters a city and clicks the search button, the weather is displayed and so is the next 5 days forecast weather.
3. The user's search history is stored and when it is clicked, the data for the clicked city shows again.

Based on this, my code would have to -
- Use the openweathermap API to get weather data
- Display this data in an organised way
- Utilise local storage to retrieve the already generated data from previous searches

## Difficulties

I struggled at first with the API but after reading the documentation it became slightly easier. I also struggled with using JQuery and so the code is written in majority vanilla JavaScript. I also could not get the local storage to display the already retrieved data. 

## Overall thoughts

I think that I complicated things for myself and then decided to start over when it was too late. Despite working on it all day I think I needed a few more hours to fix some of the bugs with local storage. I learned a lot about API's from this task so it was very worthwhile, however I need to study JQuery more and become comfortable with it.
